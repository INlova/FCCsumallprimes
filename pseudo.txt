 Input: an integer n > 1.
 
 Let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
 initially all set to true.
 
 for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding âˆšn:
   if A[i] is true:
     for j = i2, i2+i, i2+2i, i2+3i, ..., not exceeding n:
       A[j] := false.
 
 Output: all i such that A[i] is true.
 
 
"Test a number to determine whether or not it is prime. 
THEN loop from 2 all the way up to input
If the remainder of our value with the current loop value is zero then we know it is not prime so skip i.
Otherwise, add to running total and then return this value in addition to original input"
